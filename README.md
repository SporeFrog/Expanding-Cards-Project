# Expanding-Cards-Project

This is my attempt at a project from Traversy Media's Udemy course where he has 50 Projects for junior web developers to try out. 
For this project, I wanted to test what I've been learning with dom maniuplation as well as adding/removing classes from elements in HTML. 
I followed along in the set up of the html and css, but I did the js by myself with the help of documentation and stack overflow. I used a codepen to test some of the basic functionality as well.
